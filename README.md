MATLAB tools for charaterizing in vivo data from Neuropixels probes

This is a set of tools for some basic evaluation of in vivo data from Neuropixels 1.0 or Neuropixels 2.0 probes. They are written to run on data recorded by SpikeGLX and preprocessed using the CatGT tool.

For details on how to run, see: Run_instructions.txt.
